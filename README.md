Akka Tracing  [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.github.levkhomich/akka-tracing-core_2.11.svg?style=flat-square)](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.github.levkhomich%22%20akka-tracing)
============

A distributed tracing Akka extension based on [Twitter's Zipkin](http://twitter.github.io/zipkin/), which can be used as performance diagnostics and debugging tool.

It allows you to:
- trace call hierarchies inside an actor system;
- debug request processing pipelines (you can log to traces, annotate them with custom key-value pairs);
- see dependencies between derived requests and their contribution to resulting response time;
- find and analyse slowest requests in your system.

Distributed tracing approach used by Zipkin synergise with akka-remote and akka-cluster.
Extension provides integration with Play framework and Spray toolkit.

See [wiki](https://github.com/levkhomich/akka-tracing/wiki) for more information.

Getting started

The best way is to use project's activator templates:
[general features, Scala and Java API, Spray integration](https://typesafe.com/activator/template/activator-akka-tracing),
[Play integration](https://typesafe.com/activator/template/activator-play-tracing).
Also, you can read [tracing overview page](https://github.com/levkhomich/akka-tracing/wiki/Tracing-overview).
